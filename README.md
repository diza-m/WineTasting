# WineTasting


# Using only partial least squares regression for generalized linear models (the plsRglm package in R), 
# build an ensemble model to predict the quality score given to each wine from the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. 
# The data consists of chemical tests on wines and an overall assessment score averaged from at least three professional wine tasters. 

# The prediction model should be trained and will be tested on both red and white wine after joining the two datasets. 
# We will split the supplied data into an 80% training set and a 20% hold-out validation set before running your training script with a random seed.
# We will use mean absolute error as a performance metric.


# You will submit:

# Your script for training the model or ensemble in a .R file
# A short and informal paper explaining your exploratory analysis, findings, and reasoning for: 
# data splitting, feature engineering, pre-processing, model building, hyperparameter optimization, model stacking, and withholding set validation
